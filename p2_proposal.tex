\section{Project Setup}

\subsection{Game Introduction}

Assume that there are $n$ players in the game, namely we can call them player 1, player 2, ..., player $n$. \bigskip

The players sit in a circle, and start their \textbf{play} in the order of their seats. When the game starts, player 1 plays first. And after player $n$ finishes his \textbf{play}, one \textbf{round} ends, player 1 (if he is still \textbf{alive}) starts the next round. Before the game starts, shuffle the cards, and each player draws \textbf{four cards} from the deck in the above order, initialize their health points according to the \textbf{generals} they selected (will be introduced later). \bigskip

Each player has six stages in their turn, that is
\begin{itemize}
\item prepare stage (some skills can be used in this stage)
\item judge stage (judge the delayed stratagem(s))
\item draw stage (draw two cards from the deck)
\item play stage (player can play cards in this stage)
\item discard stage (player can only hold cards no more than their health points, the exceeding cards will be discarded)
\item finish stage (some skills can be used in this stage)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Normal Cards}

There are four types of normal cards in the game:
\begin{itemize}
\item fight: fight another player, if he doesn't play a ``dodge'', cause damage (default: 1)
\item dodge: dodge from a fight (can not be played initiatively)
\item peach: recover one health point, can be used on another player only if his health point is 0
\item wine: recover one health point when own health point is 0, or add 1 damage to the next ``fight'' in this stage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Countries and Generals}

Before the game starts, each player can select two generals in the same country. There are four countries: \textbf{SHU}, \textbf{WU}, \textbf{WEI} and \textbf{QUN}. The game ends when only player(s) from one country is/are alive and every player had claimed his country. \bigskip

The general cards are placed upside down initially, which means the identities of a player (including his country and generals) are kept secret, and he doesn't belong to any country. When he \textbf{turns over} any of his generals, his country is claimed, thus everyone in the game will know it. When a player is dead, all of his generals will be \textbf{turned over} and his country will be claimed. \bigskip

If a player first \textbf{turns over} at least one of his generals, he can draw three cards from the deck.
